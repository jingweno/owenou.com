title: Agile is an adjective, not a noun!
categories: agile

[Dave Thomas][1] was right, [thereâ€™s a growing tendency to treat the word "Agile" as a noun][2]. Being an agile software developer means doing things in an agile manner, not just naming things that you do "Agile". Being an agile software developer means persisting your agile way of doing things, not compromising it in any case. Being an agile software developer means evangelizing your core values, not isolating your agile self.

If you miss any of these, you are just fooling yourself.
