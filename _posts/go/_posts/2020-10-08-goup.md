title: Goup - Elegant Go installer
categories: goup go

[Goup](https://github.com/owenthereal/goup) (pronounced Go Up) is an elegant solution to install Go and manage Go versions.

It is notorious that an operating system's package manager takes time to update Go to the latest version, particularly on Linux distros.
At the time of this writing in October 2020, Fedora 32's Go version from [dnf](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF) is 1.14.9, while the latest Go version is 1.15.2.

There are a bunch of solutions to install Go or manage Go versions outside of a package manager:
[golang/dl](https://github.com/golang/dl), [getgo](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/cmd/getgo), [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm), [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv), to name a few.
All of them either do not work well on all Linux distros (I ran into errors with `gvm` and `goenv` on Fedora) or do not provide the developer experience that I like (`golang/dl` requires a Go compiler to pre-exist; `getgo` can only install the latest Go)

I want a Go installer that:

* Has a minimum prerequisite to install, e.g., does not need a Go compiler to pre-exist.
* Is installed with a one-liner.
* Runs well on all operating systems (at least runs well on *uix as a start).
* Installs the latest Go once it is available on [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl).
* Installs any version of Go and switches to it, e.g., an older version of Go or tip.
* Does not inject magic into your shell.
* Is written in Go.

`goup` is an attempt to fulfill the above features and is heavily inspired by [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

You can install `goup` with one line:

```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owenthereal/goup/master/install.sh | sh

```

You can install the latest Go and switch to it:

```
$ goup install

You can check the currently active Go version:

```
$ goup show
go1.15.2
```

You can install tip and switch to it:

```
$ goup install tip
